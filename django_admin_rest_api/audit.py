"""Access to Django's admin audit log (``LogEntry``).

This module is deliberately **outside** ``django_admin_rest_api/api/``.
The ``api/`` package obeys the hard rule (``SECURITY.md`` §3 rule 10 /
``ACCEPTANCE.md`` §3.1 B-2): every **consumer-model** queryset starts
from ``ModelAdmin.get_queryset(request)``, never ``Model.objects.*``.

``django.contrib.admin.models.LogEntry`` is **not** a consumer model —
it is Django's own framework audit table, and Django's own
``ModelAdmin.history_view`` reads it via ``LogEntry.objects.filter(...)``
directly. The get_queryset rule is categorically inapplicable to it.
Keeping the LogEntry access here, in its own single-responsibility
module, makes that distinction explicit at the file-system level rather
than burying a special case inside the consumer-model API layer.

Public surface:

- :func:`object_log_entries` — the ``LogEntry`` queryset for one object,
  newest-first, with the acting user pre-fetched.
- :func:`recent_actions_for_user` — the most recent ``LogEntry`` rows for
  one user (the index "Recent actions" panel), newest-first.
