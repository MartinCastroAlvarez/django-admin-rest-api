"""``list_filter`` surfacing for the list endpoint (Issue #56).

Wire contract: ``docs/api-contract.md`` §3.3.

When a ``ModelAdmin`` declares ``list_filter = (...)``, the list
endpoint:

1. Surfaces the filter metadata (`filters: [...]`) so the client can
   render the left-sidebar filter strip.
2. Reads per-filter query params and narrows the queryset accordingly.

Supported filter types in v1:

- **`SimpleListFilter` subclass** — the filter's own ``parameter_name``
  + ``lookups(request, model_admin)`` drive the client's options;
  ``queryset(request, qs)`` does the narrowing.
- **Boolean field** — three-way: ``true`` / ``false`` / unset.
- **Field with choices** — one option per choice.
- **ForeignKey** — small target tables only (≤ 25 rows per PM ruling).
  The client fetches choices via the existing list endpoint when needed.
- **DateField / DateTimeField** — the date_hierarchy strip (Issue #62)
  handles the heavy case; ``list_filter`` on a date field is surfaced
  as ``{type: "date"}`` but defers detailed date-range UX to a follow-up.

Hard rules (`SECURITY.md` §3):

- Rule 10: Queryset starts at ``ModelAdmin.get_queryset(request)``;
  filters are applied on top, never bypass the admin's gate.
- Rule 12: Unknown filter params are silently ignored. Garbage values
  ("``?status=garbage``") fall through to the admin's own validation —
  if the admin would reject the value, the queryset returns no rows
  (which is the correct posture — a 500 would be wrong).
