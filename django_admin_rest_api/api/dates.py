"""Date-hierarchy drill-down for the list endpoint.

Wire contract: ``docs/api-contract.md`` §3.1.

When a ``ModelAdmin`` declares ``date_hierarchy = "<field>"``, the list
endpoint:

1. Surfaces metadata (``field``, ``granularity_options``) in the
   response.
2. Reads ``?year=`` / ``?month=`` / ``?day=`` query params and
   narrows the queryset to that date window.
3. Returns ``buckets`` — the next-level drill-down counts the client
   needs to render the admin's year → month → day strip.

Hard rules (`SECURITY.md` §3):

- Rule 10: Never starts from ``Model.objects.all()`` — the queryset
  passed in is the one already produced by
  ``ModelAdmin.get_queryset(request)``.
- Rule 12: Garbage input (non-integer query params, out-of-range
  values, unknown field) is silently ignored, never raises — a
  hostile ``?year=abc`` must not produce a 500.

The helper is queryset-shape-agnostic: as long as the field is a
``DateField`` or ``DateTimeField`` on the model, the standard
``__year`` / ``__month`` / ``__day`` ORM lookups work.
