"""Per-model panel endpoint mixin (Issue #65).

Wire contract: ``docs/extensions.md`` §2.

Consumers register custom data endpoints under a model's detail URL
without re-implementing auth / model-resolution / permission gates.
Opt-in via the ``PanelEndpointsMixin`` on a ``ModelAdmin``:

::

    # Register your admin in the usual way — the mixin is orthogonal
    # to whichever registration syntax (decorator or call form) you
    # already use.
    class InvoiceAdmin(PanelEndpointsMixin, admin.ModelAdmin):
        panels = {"audit_trail": "get_audit_trail"}

        def get_audit_trail(self, request, obj):
            return {"entries": [...]}

URL shape: ``GET …/<app>/<model>/<pk>/panel/<name>/``

Hard rules (`SECURITY.md` §3):

- Rule 5: ``has_view_permission(request, obj)`` per-object gate.
- Rule 10: Object loaded via ``ModelAdmin.get_queryset(request)``.
- Rule 12: Unknown panel names → 404 (no oracle).
- Panel name is re-resolved through ``model_admin.panels`` — never
  used as a direct method lookup against the admin instance.
