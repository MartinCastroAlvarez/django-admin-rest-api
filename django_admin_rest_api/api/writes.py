"""Shared helpers for the write endpoints (POST / PATCH / DELETE).

Wire contract: ``docs/api-contract.md`` §5 and §6.

Hard rules (`SECURITY.md` §3, `ACCEPTANCE.md` §3.1):

- Rule 6:  Writes go through ``ModelAdmin.get_form()`` — never
           ``setattr(obj, ...)`` directly (B-3).
- Rule 7:  Deletes go through ``ModelAdmin.delete_model()`` — never
           ``obj.delete()`` (B-4).
- Rule 12: ``readonly`` / ``exclude`` field names in the payload are a
           400 ``bad_request`` (S-31, B-3).
- Defense-in-depth: sensitive-name denylist is applied on top of the
  admin's own ``exclude`` so a misconfigured admin still cannot leak.

Public surface — every view layer should reach for one of these first:

- :func:`bad_request`            — uniform 400 envelope.
- :func:`validation_failed`      — uniform 400 with per-field errors.
- :func:`not_found_response`     — canonical 404 envelope.
- :func:`parse_json_body`        — decode a JSON object or return 400.
- :func:`load_object_or_none`    — fetch through ``get_queryset`` or
                                   return ``None`` (caller emits 404).
- :func:`writable_field_names`   — fields the API will accept on write.
- :func:`readonly_or_excluded_names`
                                 — fields the payload may not mention.
- :func:`reject_forbidden_keys`  — payload-shape validation gate.
- :func:`coerce_fk_values`       — accept FK envelope on input.
- :func:`form_errors_to_envelope`
                                 — Django form errors → wire shape.
- :func:`merged_initial_for_update`
                                 — instance + payload → form data.

    Django changed the API surface between 5.x and 6.x:

    - 5.x had both ``log_deletion(request, obj, object_repr)`` (single)
      and ``log_deletions(request, queryset)`` (plural).
    - 6.x kept only ``log_deletions(request, queryset)`` — the singular
      form was removed.

    We always use the plural form so the same call works on both. The
    queryset is derived from the model admin's own ``get_queryset`` so
    any consumer override (e.g. row-level filters) is respected; we
    then narrow it to the one object we're about to delete.
    """
    # ``.filter`` is invoked on the QuerySet returned by
    # ``get_queryset`` — not on ``Model.objects`` — so the package's
    # "no objects.all/filter in api/" lint rule does not apply.
    queryset = model_admin.get_queryset(request).filter(pk=obj.pk)
    model_admin.log_deletions(request, queryset)
