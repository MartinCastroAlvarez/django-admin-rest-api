"""Permission helpers.

The package's default permission gate is:

    user.is_authenticated and user.is_active and user.is_staff
    and admin_site.has_permission(request)

Per-operation gates always go through the relevant
``ModelAdmin.has_*_permission(request, obj=None)`` method.

403 responses come in two flavours so the client can distinguish "you were
never authenticated" from "your session expired" (Issue #63):

- ``error.code = "forbidden"`` — generic permission denial; the client
  redirects to the configured login URL.
- ``error.code = "session_expired"`` — the request carried a session
  cookie but the resolved user is anonymous; the client shows a re-login
  modal that returns the user to the same page after sign-in.

See ``SECURITY.md`` §3 (rules 1 and 12) for the contract this enforces
and ``docs/api-contract.md`` §6 for the wire shape.

    cookie there's nothing to expire — the user is just not signed
    in (the canonical anonymous case the contract has always handled).

    and the resolved ``request.user`` only. Defensive fallback to
