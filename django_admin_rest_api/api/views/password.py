"""``POST /api/v1/<app>/<model>/<pk>/password/`` — admin password set/change.

Wire contract: ``docs/api-contract.md`` §5.4.

A thin JSON shell over the admin's **own** password-change form — the
same philosophy as the login endpoint (``views/auth.py``): the package
never invents password handling. Django's ``UserAdmin`` exposes
``change_password_form`` (default ``AdminPasswordChangeForm``); this view
instantiates *that* form, validates it (which runs the configured
``AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS``), and calls ``form.save()`` — which routes
through ``user.set_password()``, so the password is hashed by Django's
configured hasher and a plaintext value is never persisted.

Hard rules (`SECURITY.md` §3):

- Rule 1:  The admin's ``change_password_form`` + ``set_password`` are
           the only password machinery — no parallel implementation.
- Rule 3:  Model resolved through ``admin.site._registry`` (B-7).
- Rule 5:  ``has_change_permission(request, obj)`` per-object gate —
           the same permission Django's own ``user_change_password``
           view requires.
- Rule 12: The 404 / 403 bodies leak no app/model/pk oracle.

Security properties (each is load-bearing — see ``tests/test_password.py``):

- **The password is never read back.** The success body is
  ``{"detail": ..., "id": pk}`` — no password, no hash, nothing derived
  from the credential. The model's password field also stays hidden in
  every read response via the sensitive-name denylist.
- **The password is never logged or echoed.** It is read from the JSON
  body, handed straight to the admin form, and never formatted into a
  message or response. Validation errors are mapped by *field name*
  (``password1`` / ``password2``), never by value.
- **CSRF is enforced.** This view is not ``@csrf_exempt``; Django's
  ``CsrfViewMiddleware`` runs before this code, so a forged cross-site
  POST cannot reset a victim's password.
- **Models without the affordance 404.** A model whose admin does not
  declare ``change_password_form`` (i.e. anything but a ``UserAdmin``)
  has no ``/password/`` sub-resource — mirroring Django, whose router
  only registers the password URL on ``UserAdmin``.
- **The acting admin is not logged out.** When a user changes *their
  own* password, ``update_session_auth_hash`` rotates the session auth
  hash so the current session survives — exactly what Django's
  ``user_change_password`` view does.
- **``Cache-Control: no-store``** on every response.

Out of scope (same as login, documented in ``SECURITY.md`` §2):
brute-force throttling. The package never replaces Django's password
*mechanism*, only adds a JSON entry point to it; rate limiting remains
the consumer's job (``django-ratelimit`` / ``django-axes``).
