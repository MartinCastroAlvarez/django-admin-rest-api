"""``GET /api/v1/<app>/<model>/<pk>/delete-preview/`` — cascade preview.

Wire contract: ``docs/api-contract.md`` §5.3 (delete preview sub-resource).

Django's HTML admin shows a confirmation interstitial before a delete:
what cascades, what's protected, what extra permissions are needed. The
SPA's Delete button should open the same preview before invoking the
DELETE endpoint — otherwise a single click can silently cascade-delete
related rows the operator never saw. Parity (#153).

Reuses ``django.contrib.admin.utils.get_deleted_objects`` — the exact
function the HTML admin's ``delete_view`` uses — so the cascade,
protected, and perms-needed sets match the legacy admin 1:1.

Hard rules (`SECURITY.md` §3):

- Rule 1:  Staff + ``AdminSite.has_permission`` gate.
- Rule 3:  Model resolved through ``admin.site._registry`` (B-7).
- Rule 5:  Per-object ``has_delete_permission`` gate.
- Rule 10: Object loaded through ``ModelAdmin.get_queryset(request)``.
- CSRF:    GET is safe; this endpoint never deletes — it only previews.
