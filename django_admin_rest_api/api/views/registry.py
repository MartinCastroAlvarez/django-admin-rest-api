"""GET /api/v1/registry/ — apps and models the user may see.

Wire contract: ``docs/api-contract.md`` §2.

Implementation rules followed (`SECURITY.md` §3):

- Rule 1:  Default permission gate is staff + ``AdminSite.has_permission``.
- Rule 3:  Models come exclusively from the configured admin site's
           ``_registry`` — we never look at the global app registry.
- Rule 5:  ``ModelAdmin.has_module_permission`` and ``has_view_permission``
           decide visibility; we never invent our own gate.
- Rule 10: No ``Model.objects.all()`` is ever called from this view —
           it doesn't read any model data at all.
- Rule 12: Failures return 403 with an opaque body, never 404.
