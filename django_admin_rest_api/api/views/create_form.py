"""``GET /api/v1/<app>/<model>/add/`` — the create-form schema.

The detail view (``/<pk>/``) needs an existing object; the client's
create page needs the same field descriptors + fieldsets for a *new*
object. This view builds that payload from an unsaved instance, the
add form (``get_form(request, obj=None, change=False)`` — exactly how
Django's add view builds it), and the read-visible field set.

It deliberately reuses the detail view's descriptor builders so the
field shape is byte-for-byte identical to what edit renders — the client
uses one ``FieldInput`` component for both.

Hard rules: staff gate (rule 1), model resolved through the registry
(rule 3), ``has_add_permission`` gate (rule 6 — create is gated on
add, not view), sensitive-name denylist applied (S-31).
