"""``POST /api/v1/<app>/<model>/actions/<action_name>/`` — run an admin action.

Wire contract: ``docs/api-contract.md`` §5.4.

Powers Django admin's ``actions = [...]`` mechanism for the client. The
caller picks an action by name and a list of pks; the package
re-resolves the action through ``ModelAdmin.get_actions(request)``
(never trusts the action name client-side), then runs it over the
queryset narrowed to those pks **and** the admin's own
``get_queryset(request)`` (so the action cannot touch rows the user
isn't allowed to see).

Hard rules (`SECURITY.md` §3):

- Rule 1:  Staff + ``AdminSite.has_permission`` gate.
- Rule 3:  Model resolved through ``admin.site._registry`` (B-7).
- Rule 5:  ``has_change_permission`` per-action gate (matches the
           legacy admin's posture — actions are change-shaped).
- Rule 10: Queryset starts at ``ModelAdmin.get_queryset(request)``
           and is narrowed by ``pk__in=<pks>`` — never bypasses the
           admin's row-level filtering (B-2).
- Rule 12: Bad input (unknown action name, empty pks) returns 400/404
           with the canonical envelope. Action callables may raise;
           we let those propagate as 500 so the consumer sees the
           real cause in their logs (we don't want to silently swallow
           an admin author's bug).
- CSRF:    No ``@csrf_exempt`` — Django's middleware enforces.

# Signature inspection — used to decide whether a registered
# ``ModelAdmin.actions`` callable expects a ``QuerySet`` (changelist
# / "batch" shape) or a single object id (detail-page shape).
#
# Two signals, in order:
#
#   1. Parameter name. Stock Django actions use ``queryset``; consumers
#      writing detail-shaped actions tend to use ``obj_id`` / ``object_id``
#      / ``pk`` / ``id``. Name match is cheap and reliable.
#   2. Type annotation. Falls back to ``QuerySet`` / ``Model`` /
#      ``str`` / ``int`` annotations when names are ambiguous.
#
# Anything not classified as ``detail`` defaults to ``batch`` — that
# preserves stock Django's contract (every action takes a queryset).
