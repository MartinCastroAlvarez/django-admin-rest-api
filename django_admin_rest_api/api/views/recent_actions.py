"""``GET /api/v1/recent-actions/`` — the current user's recent actions.

Mirrors Django admin's index "Recent actions" panel: the signed-in
user's own last few ``LogEntry`` rows, newest first, each linking to
the affected object's change page when that object is still reachable.

Like the rest of the API this is staff-gated and ``Cache-Control:
no-store``. It is scoped to ``request.user`` — a user only ever sees
their own action log, never anyone else's (``SECURITY.md`` §3 rule 12).
The link target is gated by the target model's admin registration +
view permission, so the panel never links into a 403/404.
