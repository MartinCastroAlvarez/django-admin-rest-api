"""Shared test helpers for the django-admin-rest-api test suite.

This module holds utilities that are *not* pytest fixtures (those live
in ``conftest.py``). The split keeps fixture discovery automatic while
letting regular helpers be imported with ``from tests.helpers import X``.

    Each keyword maps an attribute name on the admin instance to a
    function. The function is bound to the admin for the duration of
    the ``with`` block, then restored on exit.

    Example::

        with admin_override(Group, has_view_permission=lambda self, request, obj=None: False):
            response = client.get(LIST_URL)

    This is the canonical way to test "what does the admin say?"
    without swapping users — the user identity is not the contract;
    the admin's answer is. The contract is enforced by
    ``ModelAdmin.has_*_permission`` (and the related hooks like
    ``get_queryset``, ``save_model``, ``delete_model``); this helper
    lets each test pin those answers per-test.
